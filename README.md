The silk project
====

The silk project contains a collection of modular and reusable 
libraries that compile Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode to
LLVM bitcode. Silk simplifies the task of constructing virtual
machines and static compilers for CIL on commodity hardware platforms,
notably x86, x86-64 and ARM.

Code in the silk project is licensed under the "UIUC" BSD-Style
license.
